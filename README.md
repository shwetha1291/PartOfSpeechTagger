   We are provided with an existing dataset of  sentences that have all the words in them tagged based on their part of speech like 
   
1. Noun
2. Verb
3. Proverb etc. 

The task is to employ machine learning algorithms to help our model learn from this dataset after it has been cross validated into testing and training sets.
We employ algorithms like Naive Bayes , MCMC and Viterbi algorithms to make the model effective.
